Hi! I'm a self taught amateur. I prefer to write C# in Visual Studio. 
I enjoy doing Advent of Code to think about algorithms, big O complexity,
data structures, and use it as a springboard to practice different styles.
I may write something in a very C like style one day, and do something
in an Object Oriented style using Test Driven Development another day!

You're welcome to see and use my code as you like, but I will likely not
respond to commentary.
